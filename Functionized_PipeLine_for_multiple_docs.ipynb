      "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n",

      "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
      "LayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",

      "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
      "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",

      "3.2 Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",

      "query with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
      "values.\n",
      "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",

      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",

      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",

      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",

      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",

      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",

      "This paper presents an extension to the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm, called Deep SORT, that incorporates appearance information to improve its performance. SORT is a simple and efficient multiple object tracking framework that utilizes Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association. However, it struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its reliance on bounding box overlap as the sole association metric. \n",
      "\n",
      "Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large-scale person re-identification dataset is used to extract appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper outlines the implementation details of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of uncertainty in Kalman filter predictions. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "Experimental evaluation on the MOT16 benchmark demonstrates Deep SORT's effectiveness. It significantly reduces the number of identity switches compared to SORT, achieving a 45% decrease while maintaining competitive MOTA scores, track fragmentations, and false negatives. The paper also highlights the strengths and limitations of Deep SORT in comparison to other online tracking methods.\n",

      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes deep convolutional networks to generate high-quality images. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",

      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes deep convolutional networks to generate high-quality images. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes deep convolutional networks to generate high-quality images. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

G is trained to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework is a minimax two-player game. It is proven that a unique solution exists where G recovers the training data distribution and D equals 1/2 everywhere. \n",

      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator.

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), a novel framework for estimating generative models. GANs consist of two competing models: a generator (G) that learns the data distribution and a discriminator (D) that distinguishes between real and generated data. G aims to deceive D by producing realistic samples, while D strives to accurately classify samples. This adversarial process drives both models to improve until G effectively replicates the data distribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "The paper proves that a unique solution exists where G recovers the training data distribution and D outputs 1/2 for all samples. GANs offer significant advantages over previous generative models like RBMs, DBNs, and GSNs. They avoid the need for Markov chains or approximate inference networks during training and generation, enabling efficient training using backpropagation and dropout algorithms. This allows GANs to model complex distributions while maintaining high efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also explores the theoretical properties of GANs, proving the global optimality of the framework and demonstrating the convergence of the training algorithm. The authors showcase the potential of GANs through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of generated samples, highlighting their ability to generate realistic and diverse data.\n",

      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), a novel framework for estimating generative models. GANs utilize a two-player minimax game where a generative model (G) learns to capture the data distribution and a discriminative model (D) estimates the probability of a sample originating from the training data or from G. G is trained to maximize D's error rate. The paper proves that a unique solution exists where G recovers the training data distribution and D outputs 1/2 for all samples. \n",
      "\n",
      "GANs demonstrate significant advantages over previous generative models like RBMs, DBNs, and GSNs. They avoid the need for Markov chains or approximate inference networks during training and generation, enabling efficient training using backpropagation and dropout algorithms. This allows GANs to model complex distributions while maintaining high efficiency.\n",

      "The paper also explores the theoretical properties of GANs, proving the global optimality of the framework and demonstrating the convergence of the training algorithm.

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Foundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have\n",
      "emerged as an eﬀective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence\n",

      "Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to\n",
      "a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence\n",
      "model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015)\n",
      "The eﬃcacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window,\n",
      "allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model\n",
      "anything outside of a ﬁnite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body\n",
      "of research has appeared on more eﬃcient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani,\n",

      "example, by constructing a convolution kernel of exactly the right length (Figure 2). This was explicitly validated\n",
      "in earlier work on global convolutions (Romero et al. 2021). The Selective Copying task prevents this shortcut\n",
      "by randomizing the spacing between tokens. Note that this task has been introduced before as the Denoising\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",

      "This paper introduces Mask R-CNN, a novel framework for object instance segmentation that builds upon Faster R-CNN. It achieves this by adding a branch for predicting object masks alongside the existing bounding box recognition branch. This approach provides efficient object detection and high-quality instance segmentation, making it a simple yet effective solution.\n",

Additionally, Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction, predicting a binary mask for each class independently. This significantly improves performance compared to traditional multi-class categorization approaches.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",

      "Classical techniques, such as flipping, rotating, cropping, resizing, color jittering, adding noise, image warping, and random erasing, are simple, effective, and computationally efficient. Advanced techniques, including Cutout, Mixup, Cutmix, and Augmix, offer more sophisticated approaches to data augmentation. Cutout randomly covers a region of an image with a square, helping models learn to recognize partial or occluded objects. Mixup generates synthetic training examples by combining random image pairs, reducing overfitting and providing a smoother estimate of uncertainty. Cutmix replaces a square region of an image with a patch from another image, avoiding uninformative pixels during training. Augmix uses multiple chains of augmentation operations, combined with the original image using different weights, creating more diverse and realistic training data.\n",

      "The document concludes by highlighting the significant impact of data augmentation on the performance of image classification and object detection models. Advanced techniques like CutMix, MixUp, and Augmix, by generating more diverse and realistic training data, encourage models to learn more robust features, ultimately leading to improved accuracy and generalization.\n",

      "Mamba is a novel, linear-time sequence modeling architecture that leverages selective structured state space models (SSMs) to achieve performance comparable to or surpassing Transformers across various domains. Mamba's key innovation lies in its selective SSMs, which allow the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the current token, enabling content-based reasoning. This is achieved by parameterizing SSM parameters as functions of the input, a departure from traditional time-invariant models. \n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome the computational challenges posed by this change, Mamba utilizes a hardware-aware parallel algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan, avoiding the materialization of large states. This implementation is faster than previous methods and scales linearly with sequence length.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mamba further simplifies its architecture by eliminating the need for attention or MLP blocks, resulting in a homogeneous design with fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. This enables performance improvements on real data up to million-length sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamba's capabilities have been demonstrated across various modalities: synthetics, audio, genomics, and language modeling. It excels in tasks like Selective Copying and Induction Heads, outperforms state-of-the-art models in audio and genomics, and achieves Transformer-quality performance in language modeling, surpassing various baselines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamba's key advantages include high quality, fast training and inference, and effective long-context handling. It is a strong candidate for a general sequence model backbone, particularly in emerging domains requiring long context.\n",

      "This paper introduces Mask R-CNN, a powerful framework for object instance segmentation that builds upon Faster R-CNN. It achieves this by adding a branch for predicting object masks alongside the existing bounding box recognition branch. This approach provides efficient object detection and high-quality instance segmentation, making it a simple yet effective solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key innovations include RoIAlign, a quantization-free layer replacing RoIPool for accurate spatial alignment between network inputs and outputs, crucial for pixel-accurate mask prediction. Additionally, Mask R-CNN decouples mask and class prediction, predicting a binary mask for each class independently. This significantly improves performance compared to traditional multi-class categorization approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mask R-CNN demonstrates its effectiveness on the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in instance segmentation, bounding box object detection, and person keypoint detection. It outperforms previous single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.\n",

      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes deep convolutional networks to generate high-quality images. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",

      "Mamba is a novel, linear-time sequence modeling architecture that leverages selective structured state space models (SSMs) to achieve performance comparable to or surpassing Transformers across various domains. Mamba's key innovation lies in its selective SSMs, which allow the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the current token, enabling content-based reasoning. This is achieved by parameterizing SSM parameters as functions of the input, a departure from traditional time-invariant models. \n",

      "To overcome the computational challenges posed by this change, Mamba utilizes a hardware-aware parallel algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan, avoiding the materialization of large states. This implementation is faster than previous methods and scales linearly with sequence length.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mamba further simplifies its architecture by eliminating the need for attention or MLP blocks, resulting in a homogeneous design with fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. This enables performance improvements on real data up to million-length sequences.\n",

      "This document explains the purpose and implementation of the `mismatched_images` variable in the Stage1 model of a StackGAN. It focuses on how training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with intentionally mismatched image-text pairs enhances the discriminator's ability to recognize and enforce accurate image-text alignment during image generation. This mismatched data, created by shifting the image batch, forces the discriminator to learn to identify inconsistencies between images and their associated text descriptions. By learning to distinguish correct from incorrect alignments, the discriminator guides the generator towards generating images that are more closely aligned with the provided text descriptions. This technique contributes to improved image quality and faithfulness to the input text in conditional GANs like StackGAN.\n",

SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",

      "This document explains the purpose and implementation of the `mismatched_images` variable in the Stage1 model of a StackGAN. It focuses on how training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with intentionally mismatched image-text pairs enhances the discriminator's ability to recognize and enforce accurate image-text alignment during image generation. This mismatched data, created by shifting the image batch, forces the discriminator to learn to identify inconsistencies between images and their associated text descriptions. By learning to distinguish correct from incorrect alignments, the discriminator guides the generator towards generating images that are more closely aligned with the provided text descriptions. This technique contributes to improved image quality and faithfulness to the input text in conditional GANs like StackGAN.\n",

      "This paper introduces SORT, a simple and efficient online multiple object tracking (MOT) framework that prioritizes frame-to-frame prediction and association. SORT leverages the Faster Region CNN (FrRCNN) for object detection, achieving significant performance gains over traditional detectors. It employs a Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm for motion prediction and data association, respectively, resulting in a robust and computationally lightweight approach. SORT surpasses other online trackers in terms of MOTA while being comparable to the most accurate but more complex NOMT method. Notably, SORT demonstrates minimal lost targets, showcasing its strong frame-to-frame association capabilities. With a runtime performance of 260Hz on a single core, SORT is highly suitable for real-time applications. The authors propose future research directions, including exploring a tightly coupled detection and tracking framework for further performance enhancements. \n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",

      "This paper presents Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a novel framework for estimating generative models. GANs employ two competing models: a generator (G) that learns the data distribution and a discriminator (D) that distinguishes between real and generated data.

This adversarial process drives both models to improve until the generator effectively replicates the data distribution. \n",

GANs utilize a two-player minimax game where a generative model (G) learns to capture the data distribution and a discriminative model (D) estimates the probability of a sample originating from the training data or from G. G is trained to maximize D's error rate. The paper proves that a unique solution exists where G recovers the training data distribution and D outputs 1/2 for all samples. \n",

      "GANs demonstrate significant advantages over previous generative models like RBMs, DBNs, and GSNs. They avoid the need for Markov chains or approximate inference networks during training and generation, enabling efficient training using backpropagation and dropout algorithms. This allows GANs to model complex distributions while maintaining high efficiency.\n",

      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of image augmentation, a powerful technique used to improve the performance of computer vision models. The document addresses the challenges faced in computer vision, including image variations, class imbalance, domain shift, and overfitting. It explores both classical and advanced image augmentation techniques. \n",
      "\n",
      "Classical techniques, such as flipping, rotating, cropping, resizing, color jittering, adding noise, image warping, and random erasing, are simple, effective, and computationally efficient. Advanced techniques, including Cutout, Mixup, Cutmix, and Augmix, offer more sophisticated approaches to data augmentation. Cutout randomly covers a region of an image with a square, helping models learn to recognize partial or occluded objects. Mixup generates synthetic training examples by combining random image pairs, reducing overfitting and providing a smoother estimate of uncertainty. Cutmix replaces a square region of an image with a patch from another image, avoiding uninformative pixels during training. Augmix uses multiple chains of augmentation operations, combined with the original image using different weights, creating more diverse and realistic training data.\n",

      "Mamba is a novel, linear-time sequence modeling architecture that leverages selective structured state space models (SSMs) to achieve performance comparable to or surpassing Transformers across various domains. Mamba's key innovation lies in its selective SSMs, which allow the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the current token, enabling content-based reasoning. This is achieved by parameterizing SSM parameters as functions of the input, a departure from traditional time-invariant models. \n",

It focuses on how training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with intentionally mismatched image-text pairs enhances the discriminator's ability to recognize and enforce accurate image-text alignment during image generation. This mismatched data, created by shifting the image batch, forces the discriminator to learn to identify inconsistencies between images and their associated text descriptions. By learning to distinguish correct from incorrect alignments, the discriminator guides the generator towards generating images that are more closely aligned with the provided text descriptions. This technique contributes to improved image quality and faithfulness to the input text in conditional GANs like StackGAN.\n",

      "    * **Stage-II GAN:** Takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as input to generate high-resolution images with photo-realistic details, rectifying defects and adding compelling details.\n",
      "* **Conditioning Augmentation:** Introduces a novel technique to encourage smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold, improving the diversity of synthesized images and stabilizing the training of conditional GANs.\n",
      "* **Performance Improvements:**  StackGAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets (CUB, Oxford-102, and MS COCO) in terms of Inception score and human evaluation, achieving the first photo-realistic image generation of 256x256 resolution from text descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methodology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Text Encoding:**  Pre-trained encoder converts text descriptions into text embeddings.\n",
      "* **Conditioning Variables:**  Gaussian conditioning variables are sampled from a distribution determined by the text embedding, capturing the meaning with variations.\n",
      "* **Stage-I GAN:**  Generates low-resolution images with rough shapes and colors, focusing on object representation.\n",
      "* **Stage-II GAN:** Refines Stage-I results, correcting defects and adding details based on the text description, producing high-resolution images.\n",
      "* **Matching-aware Discriminator:** Enforces alignment between image and text by learning to differentiate between real image-text pairs and mismatched or synthetic pairs.\n",

      "**Experimental Results:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* StackGAN achieves significantly higher Inception scores and human evaluation rankings compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "* The stacked architecture proves crucial for generating high-quality images, while Conditioning Augmentation enhances diversity and stabilizes training.\n",
      "* Analysis shows that processing text descriptions again in Stage-II refines the results and improves detail.\n",
      "* StackGAN demonstrates the ability to transfer and refine background from Stage-I to Stage-II, contributing to a more realistic image.\n",
      "* Interpolation of sentence embeddings shows that StackGAN learns a smooth latent data manifold, enabling gradual appearance changes in generated images.\n",

Unlike its predecessors, the Transformer relies solely on attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies between input and output sequences. This innovative approach enables significant advantages in terms of parallelization, training speed, and translation quality, leading to state-of-the-art results on WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks.  Furthermore, the paper showcases the Transformer's versatility by applying it to English constituency parsing, achieving competitive results even with limited training data. \n",

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes deep convolutional networks to generate high-quality images. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document delves into the architecture of DCGANs, outlining the roles of both the generator and discriminator. The generator, responsible for creating realistic images from random noise, employs transposed convolutional layers for upsampling the noise vector into a full-sized image. Key features of the generator include its use of batch normalization, ReLU activations (except for Tanh in the output layer), and its input of a random noise vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator, on the other hand, acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real and fake images. It utilizes convolutional layers to downsample the input image and extract features, followed by a fully connected layer to output a probability score. The discriminator employs convolutional layers, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation for output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document further explains the adversarial training process, where the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The discriminator learns to identify real and fake images by maximizing the probability of assigning correct labels, while the generator aims to generate realistic images that fool the discriminator. The document provides the loss functions used for training both the discriminator and generator.\n",
      "\n",
      "This document serves as a foundational guide to understanding DCGANs, providing insights into their architecture and training process. Comprehending these components is crucial for grasping how DCGANs generate high-quality images.\n",

      "This paper presents Deep SORT, an improved version of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm that incorporates appearance information to enhance tracking performance. SORT, which relies on Kalman filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for data association, struggles with tracking objects through long periods of occlusion due to its sole reliance on bounding box overlap. Deep SORT addresses this limitation by introducing a deep association metric that combines motion and appearance information. A CNN trained on a person re-identification dataset extracts appearance descriptors for each bounding box detection. These descriptors are then used to calculate a cosine distance between tracks and detections, providing a more robust measure of similarity even during occlusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper details the implementation of Deep SORT, including track handling, state estimation, the matching cascade algorithm, and the deep appearance descriptor network. The matching cascade prioritizes tracks with more recent observations, mitigating the negative impact of Kalman filter prediction uncertainty. The deep appearance descriptor network is computationally efficient, enabling real-time operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluated on the MOT16 benchmark, Deep SORT demonstrates significantly reduced identity switches compared to SORT, achieving a 45% decrease while maintaining competitive MOTA scores, track fragmentations, and false negatives. The paper also discusses the strengths and limitations of Deep SORT in comparison to other online tracking methods.\n",

      "This document explains the purpose and implementation of the `mismatched_images` variable in the Stage1 model of a StackGAN. It focuses on how training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with intentionally mismatched image-text pairs enhances the discriminator's ability to recognize and enforce accurate image-text alignment during image generation. This mismatched data, created by shifting the image batch, forces the discriminator to learn to identify inconsistencies between images and their associated text descriptions. By learning to distinguish correct from incorrect alignments, the discriminator guides the generator towards generating images that are more closely aligned with the provided text descriptions. This technique contributes to improved image quality and faithfulness to the input text in conditional GANs like StackGAN.\n",

      "For a more systematic evaluation, we take the stocks of the German stock\n",

      "6. Conclusions\n",
      "In this paper, we have introduced LRNNs. The major innovation in this work\n",
      "is a closed-form approach to network size reduction (cf. Section 4.3) that learns\n",
      "both architecture and parameters of linearly activated RNNs. No backpropagation,\n",
      "gradient-descent, or other iterative procedure with several epochs is required, and\n",
      "the approach leads to significantly smaller, sparsely connected, and in many cases\n",
      "even minimal size networks.\n",
      "We have shown that despite its simplicity of using only linear activation in the\n",

      "This paper introduces a novel estimator for the variational lower bound, called Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB), to perform efficient approximate inference with continuous latent variables. The SGVB estimator can be easily differentiated and optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. For datasets with continuous latent variables per data point, the authors introduce the Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm, which learns an approximate inference model using the SGVB estimator. This algorithm is particularly efficient for inference and learning. \n",
      "\n",
      "The paper demonstrates the advantages of both the SGVB estimator and the AEVB algorithm through experiments. The authors compare the performance of AEVB with the Wake-Sleep algorithm and Monte Carlo EM, showing that AEVB converges faster and achieves better results. They also showcase the ability of the algorithm to visualize high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a low-dimensional manifold.\n",

The SGVB estimator enables efficient optimization using standard stochastic gradient methods, leading to the development of the Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm. AEVB learns an approximate inference model for datasets with continuous latent variables, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods like Wake-Sleep and Monte Carlo EM in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Many current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\n",
      "ity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\n",
      "reasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\n",
      "data outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\n",
      "used for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\n",
      "data (trillions of words [3]).\n",
      "However, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\n",
      "relevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\n",
      "dominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\n",
      "machine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\n",
      "or less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\n",
      "any signiﬁcant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\n",
      "With progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\n",
      "complex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\n",
      "the most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\n",
      "network based language models signiﬁcantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\n",
      "1.1 Goals of the Paper\n",

      "vectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. As\n",
      "far as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more\n",

      "50 - 100.\n",
      "We use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representa-\n",
      "tions, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that\n",
      "words can have multiple degrees of similarity [20]. This has been observed earlier in the context\n",
      "of inﬂectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\n",
      "similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to ﬁnd words that have similar\n",
      "endings [13, 14].\n",
      "Somewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\n",
      "syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\n",
      "formed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vec-\n",
      "tor(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen [20].\n",
      "In this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model\n",
      "architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test\n",
      "set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities1, and show that many such regularities\n",
      "can be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends\n",
      "on the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.\n",
      "1.2 Previous Work\n",
      "Representation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [10, 26, 8]. A very popular model\n",
      "architecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [1], where a\n",
      "feedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to\n",
      "learn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been\n",
      "followed by many others.\n",
      "Another interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [13, 14], where the word vectors are\n",
      "ﬁrst learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train\n",
      "the NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this\n",
      "work, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the ﬁrst step where the word vectors are\n",
      "learned using a simple model.\n",
      "It was later shown that the word vectors can be used to signiﬁcantly improve and simplify many\n",
      "NLP applications [4, 5, 29]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different\n",
      "model architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 29, 23, 19, 9], and some of the resulting word\n",
      "vectors were made available for future research and comparison2. However, as far as we know, these\n",
      "architectures were signiﬁcantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed\n",
      "in [13], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices\n",
      "are used [23].\n",
      "2 Model Architectures\n",
      "Many different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,\n",
      "including the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\n",

      "previously shown that they perform signiﬁcantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities\n",
      "among words [20, 31]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\n",
      "Similar to [18], to compare different model architectures we deﬁne ﬁrst the computational complex-\n",

      "2.1 Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)\n",
      "The probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [1]. It consists\n",

      "using 1-of- Vcoding, where Vis size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a\n",

      "layer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N= 10 , the size of the\n",
      "projection layer ( P) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size His typically 500 to 1000\n",
      "units. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the\n",
      "vocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionality V. Thus, the computational complexity\n",

      "representations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down\n",
      "to around log2(V). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N\u0002D\u0002H.\n",
      "In our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary\n",
      "tree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes\n",
      "in neural net language models [16]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and\n",
      "this further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree\n",
      "would require log2(V)outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires\n",
      "only about log2(Unigram perplexity (V)). For example when the vocabulary size is one million\n",

      "2.2 Recurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)\n",
      "Recurrent neural network based language model has been proposed to overcome certain limitations\n",

      "and because theoretically RNNs can efﬁciently represent more complex patterns than the shallow\n",
      "neural networks [15, 2]. The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and\n",

      "6 Conclusion\n",
      "In this paper we studied the quality of vector representations of words derived by various models on\n",
      "a collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks. We observed that it is possible to train high\n",
      "quality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network\n",
      "models (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it\n",
      "is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.\n",
      "Using the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram\n",
      "models even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That\n",
      "is several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.\n",
      "An interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the\n",
      "previous state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [11]. The publicly available RNN vectors were\n",
      "used together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman’s rank correlation\n",
      "over the previous best result [31]. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied\n",
      "to many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [12] and paraphrase detection [28]. It can\n",
      "be expected that these applications can beneﬁt from the model architectures described in this paper.\n",
      "Our ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension\n",
      "of facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for veriﬁcation of correctness of existing facts. Results\n",
      "from machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\n",
      "interesting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\n",
      "our comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\n",
